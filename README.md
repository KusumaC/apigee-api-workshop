======================

This is a sample Node.js app that shows a list of restaurants, drills down to an individual restaurant showing its details, average rating, a map, and reviews for the restaurant. You can add up to two reviews per hour.

After cloning/downloading the app, you need to go into config.js in the root level and change the Server: and UG: values to match where you are running the app and where your Usergrid database is located.

Then, start app.js and hit /demo-data to create and populate the restaurants and reviews collections.
